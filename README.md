## ILOs Demonstrated

1. Evaluate architectural models relevant to the development of enterprise applications.
    a. Example: System Overview document showing main structures and processes plus the rationale for
                choosing architecture/technology stack etc.
                
2. Select and apply programming design patterns relevant to a particular application.
    a. Example: Use of models in app (built or built-in) e.g. Horizontal Scaling
                Compute Pattern, Queueâ€”centric, Eventual Consistency etc.
                
3. Elucidate and evaluate factors relevant to the security of enterprise applications.
    a. Example: Sophistication/appropriateness of implemented Security e.g. basic authorization vs OAuth
    
4. Elucidate and evaluate factors relevant to interoperability in enteprise applications.
    a. Example: Appropriate use of services - internal (e.g. datastore) and external (e.g. Trello API).
    
5. Evaluate software tools used to support the development of enteprise applications.
    a. Example: Sophistication/appropriateness of used toolset e.g. GitHub vs Dropbox, CB/CI, evidence of
                part of a community etc.
