# Advanced Development Assignment
Wessex Apps Ltd is looking to take on graduate computing students to help them move forward with their
technological capabilities.
They primarily use Python with the Flask framework for server-side development and their own bespoke
mix of HTML, CSS and JavaScript for client-side work. They use a simple text editor to develop with and
source code is stored on GitHub and Development is done on in house servers. Apps are deployed to
dedicated hosted servers at their ISP, in some cases this is done using Travis CI to build and run tests
before deployment.
They develop, run and maintain a range of apps for clients including public facing websites, data analysis
apps, company intranets, HR and payroll systems. Some of their client’s use MS Office 365 and have
been asking for interoperability between their O365 apps and the developer’s apps.
Wessex Apps Ltd is thinking about moving their apps over to cloud computing and wants applicants for
the graduate positions to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in cloud centric technologies in one of
two ways : THE BUILD!

## Instructions

To be confirmed...

## Cloud Centric Features

1. Coming
2. Soon

## Security Featurs

1. OAuth - bla bla bla
2. Potentially create own...

## Services Interoperability

1. Slack Bot has been set-up. Used to interact with slack channel
    1a. Additionally this features the option to modify this application through the use of the slack channel
2. Trello?
3. Email Service?
4. DataStore (100%)

## ILOs Demonstrated

1. Evaluate architectural models relevant to the development of enterprise applications.
    a. Example: System Overview document showing main structures and processes plus the rationale for
                choosing architecture/technology stack etc.
                
2. Select and apply programming design patterns relevant to a particular application.
    a. Example: Use of models in app (built or built-in) e.g. Horizontal Scaling
                Compute Pattern, Queue—centric, Eventual Consistency etc.
                
3. Elucidate and evaluate factors relevant to the security of enterprise applications.
    a. Example: Sophistication/appropriateness of implemented Security e.g. basic authorization vs OAuth
    
4. Elucidate and evaluate factors relevant to interoperability in enteprise applications.
    a. Example: Appropriate use of services - internal (e.g. datastore) and external (e.g. Trello API).
    
5. Evaluate software tools used to support the development of enteprise applications.
    a. Example: Sophistication/appropriateness of used toolset e.g. GitHub vs Dropbox, CB/CI, evidence of
                part of a community etc.
